## 1 Ready-Stage
### 1.1 November Presentation
> Each band that I think my game has passed will have a `passed` value in the *passed* column.

| Bands | Criterion | Passed |
|:-----:|:---------:|:------:|
| Fail  | No or very limited game. | `passed` |
| Third | Static placeholder graphics loaded for player and one linear (straight) moving background has been implemented which has a series of different elements eg trees, buildings etc. | `passed` |
| 2:2   | Implementation of keyboard controls to move player and fully working user interface displaying both scores and lives. | `passed` |
| 2:1   | At least two functionally different non player types (“enemy”) implemented as per requirements and correct use of at least one type of collision detection against player and objects (shooting, bombing and crashing). | `passed` |
| First | Implementation of a range of controls on the XBOX controllers for player movement and shooting and use of sound and / or audio. Or, one non-linear (Blue Max type) backgrounds have been implemented. | `passed` |
| First | Evidence of correct use of data structures and algorithms (e.g. arrays, loops). Implementation of two of your own written properties and two of your own written methods. | `passed` |

### 1.2 Final Presentation
> Each band that I think my game has passed will have a `passed` value in the *passed* column.  

| Bands | Criterion | Passed |
|:-----:|:---------:|:------:|
| Fail  | Static placeholder graphics loaded for player and background. | `passed` |
| Third | Animated graphics loaded for player, enemy or special effects and two distinctly different linear (straight) moving backgrounds have been implemented. | `passed` |
| 2:2   | Implementation of keyboard to control player actions and fully working user interface displaying scores and lives and use of sound and / or audio. | `passed` |
| 2:1   | At least four functionaly  different non player (“enemy”) types implemented as per requirements and correct use of 2D collision detection against player and all objects and implementation of a range of controls on the XBOX controller. | `` |
| First | Evidence of correct use of data structures and algorithms and any two from the following three: [Final Presentation First Reference](#final-presentation-first-reference) | `` |
| First | Evidence of correct implementation of at least two of the following OOP techniques from inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation and all code has been comprehensively commented throughout the program scripts. | `` |  

### Final Presentation First Reference
    1. Implementation of at least 4 of your own written properties and 4 methods.
    2. Implementation of 2 types of game mechanic such as rewards, bonuses and power-ups which are integrated into the UI. 
    3. Two distinctly different non-linear (Blue Max type) backgrounds have been implemented
