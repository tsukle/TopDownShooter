> Each band that I think my game has passed will have a `passed` value in the passed column.

| Bands | Criterion | Passed |
|:-----:|:---------:|:------:|
| Fail | No or very limited game. | `passed` |
| Third| Static placeholder graphics loaded for player and one linear (straight) moving background has been implemented which has a series of different elements eg trees, buildings etc. | `passed` |
| 2:2  | Implementation of keyboard controls to move player and fully working user interface displaying both scores and lives. | `passed` |
| 2:1  | At least two functionally different non player types (“enemy”) implemented as per requirements and correct use of at least one type of collision detection against player and objects (shooting, bombing and crashing). | `passed` |
| First| Implementation of a range of controls on the XBOX controllers for player movement and shooting and use of sound and / or audio. Or, one non-linear (Blue Max type) backgrounds have been implemented. | `passed` |
